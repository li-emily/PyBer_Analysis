# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview

### Purpose
> V. Isualize has given you and Omar a brand-new assignment. Using your Python skills and knowledge of Pandas, you’ll create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, you’ll create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. Finally, you’ll submit a written report that summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.

### Resources
- Language: Python 3.7.10
- Interface: Jupyter Notebook
- Environment: Miniconda
- Packages: Numpy, Matplotlib, Pandas, SciPy

## Results
- Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.

# Summary
- Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.
